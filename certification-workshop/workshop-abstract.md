# CoNECD Pre-Conference Faculty Workshop

## NAMEPA Certification Workshop: Communicating the Business Case for Diversity Programs

### Workshop Description
This session is designed for new program directors, staff members, as well as individuals who have the task of presenting a strong business case for diversity programs at their institution. Participants will review core metrics in outreach, recruitment, yield programs, retention initiatives, and degrees awarded in engineering on a national level. Participants will also have an opportunity to review metrics within their state that might reveal pre-college engagement opportunities. Participants will develop a comprehensive presentation that can be used at their respective institutions to address questions and concerns from:

+ Diverse parents and students, 
+ Corporate supporters
+ Deanâ€™s diversity initiatives
+ Peer institution comparisons

Workshop facilitators will include experienced program directors and experts in the area of data visualization and analytics. Presenters include Virginia Booth Womack, NAMEPA President and introducing Kari L. Jordan, Ph.D., Director of Assessment and Community Equity, The Carpentries.

This session is a hands-on activity that will require participants to use laptop computers to navigate useful websites on student performance and academic success. Participants will receive an institution-specific standardized NAMEPA presentation file that includes:
+ Ten-year trend line on engineering enrollment and degrees awarded for their institution
+ First and second year trend lines on university retention rates
+ University ranking compared to top ten universities in enrollment and degrees awarded
+ Trend line in national SAT/ACT scores
